## Profile Selection

Whenever an ID Holder creates a connection with an Issuer, the Holder can select what kind of profile is more appropriate for that interaction. In this way, aside from the **public profile** (the original DID), they can also have a different identifier for each connection they might have with an Issuer, which is called a **private profile**.

    Your **private profile** generates a unique identifier for the organization you created it with, ensuring that your connections and interactions with them cannot be linked to any other organizations.
