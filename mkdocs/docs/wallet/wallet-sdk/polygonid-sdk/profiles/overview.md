# Profile Selection
The profiles feature allows users to have greater control over their digital identity and privacy. By default, the wallet provides a general profile (based on `genesis id`), which generates a reusable identifier that can be used to create multiple connections. Apart from the general profile, users can utilize “private” profiles that generate a unique identifier to be used for creating connections.
