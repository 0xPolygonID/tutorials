# Credential Wallet Overview

The Credential Wallet lets a user fetch claims from the Issuer and save these claims to his/her wallet. These claims are later used to prove his/her identification to a Verifier. Once the claims have been fetched and stored, a user can, later, retrieve these claims from the database, can update them, or delete them altogether. The claims have unique IDs that let a user access them seamlessly.
