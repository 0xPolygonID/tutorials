# Identity Wallet Overview

An Identity Wallet creates and stores identities for a user. A user can have more than one identity and can have several claims linked to each identity. An Identity is represented with an [Identifier](https://docs.iden3.io/getting-started/identity/identifier/) which allows the user's wallet to interact with an Issuer by authenticating itself first(before the credential can be issued).
