 
# Polygon ID SDK and Wallet App

Like any other SDK, the Polygon ID SDK is a set of tools that consists of core components including libraries, code-samples, APIs, and documentation that have been used to create the Polygon ID Wallet App. An Integrator can use this PolygonID SDK to either create their own apps (that provide similar functionality as that of Polygon ID Wallet App) or integrate the functionalities seamlessly with their existing apps. 

It is important to understand that the SDK and Wallet App are two different things. While, as you read above, Polygon ID SDK is the software development kit that acts as a core funtionality, Wallet App is an application that has been built over this SDK. This Identity Wallet helps Integrators create identities for their wallets and authenticate these identities while interacting with Issuers and Verifiers. 

So, in the nutshell, an Integrator can use Polygon ID SDK to built an Identity Wallet of his/her own and can also customise any pre-existing identity wallets using the features provided by the SDK.
