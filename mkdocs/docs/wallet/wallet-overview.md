# Wallet Overview

A digital wallet is a software that can hold and manage user's `Claims`. Based on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and cryptography, a wallet helps its Holder share data with others without expositing any other sensitive private information stored on it. Only the wallet holder has the right to decide which information to share with other entities and what needs to remain private. 

The Polygon ID Wallet is a `Privacy by Default` wallet that helps protect a user's identity (and other metadata) by using zero-knowledge protocols. The wallet interacts with an Issuer to fetch claims and with Verifier for verifying these claims.

The Polygon ID Wallet supports the following features:

- Privacy by design and Self-sovereignty: The user is in full control of his/her identity data. Exchange of Claims with other identities without the need of an intermediary or centralized authority.
