# Wallet Overview

A digital wallet is a software that can hold and manage users' `Credentials`. Based on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and cryptography, a wallet helps its Holder share data with others without exposing any other sensitive private information stored on it. Only the wallet holder has the right to decide which information to share with other entities and what needs to remain private. 

Polygon ID offers some interesting ways to get started with leveraging a credential-focused wallet. 

The Wallet SDK, for instance, is a Flutter-based SDK that can be used by developers to build applications or integrate the wallet functionalities seamlessly with their existing apps. [Get started with the Wallet SDK here](wallet-sdk/polygonid-sdk/polygonid-sdk-overview.md).

The Polygon ID Wallet app is a reference implementation built using our Wallet SDK. [Learn more about it here](wallet-sdk/polygonid-app.md). The app is available for Android and IOS:
