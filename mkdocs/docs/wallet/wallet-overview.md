# Wallet Overview

A digital wallet is a software that can hold and manage `Verifiable Credentials` (that consist of claims about the wallet holder) and digital identity data for wallet's holder. Based on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and cryptography, a wallet helps its Holder share data with others without expositing any other sensitive private information stored on it. Only the wallet holder has the right to decide which information to share with other entities and what needs to remain private. 

The Polygon ID Wallet is a `Privacy by Default` wallet that helps protecting a user's identity (and other meta data) by using zero-knowledge protocols. As seen in the The wallet interacts with an Issuer for claim ganeration and with Verifier for verifying these claims.

## Features of Polygon ID Wallet

The Polygon ID Wallet supports the following features:

- Privacy by design and Self-soveriegnity: User is in full control of his/her identity data. Excahnge of Verifiable Credentials with other identities without the need of an intermediatery or centralized authroity. 
- Open and Permissionless. 
- Fetching, storing, and managing claims
- Generating cost optimized zero-knowldege proofs for claim verification.
- Authentication with Issuer and Verifier based on QR Codes/biometrics.
- Identity recovery using seed phrase.
- Supports generating zero-knowledge proofs, hence ensures data security.
