# Query Language

The [`Atomic Query Signature Circuit`](../circuits/main-circuits.md#credentialatomicquerysig) and [`Atomic Query MTP`](../circuits/main-circuits.md#credentialatomicquerymtp) circuits have been designed as generic circuits to do ZK verification based on user's claims. 

The Query language sits on top of these circuits to provide a way for developers to design customised requirements based on someone's claims.

Platforms can implement queries for user authentication/verification in a flexible way using the Query Language operators, for example:

- Must be an admin inside PolygonDAO to vote for a specific proposal - `equals`
- Must have been born before 2000-01-01 to access an adult content website - `less-than`
- Must have a monthly salary greater than $1000 to get a loan - `greater-than`
- Must have one game item across a list of items to enter a tournament - `ìn`
- Must not be resident of one country inside a list of countries to operate on an exchange - `not-in`

Starting from the proof generated by the user, the verifier is easily able to check if the query is satisfied or not. The verifier **doesn't get access to any user's data**.

As long as the user has been issued a claim that contain certain information, the verifier can design a specific query related to the claim based on these 5 operators. 

> The data structure of the claim described below is simplified. More details about the actual claim strucutre can be found [here](../getting-started/claim/generic-claim.md)

### Equals

**Claim**
```json
PolygonDAOMember {
  "role": "5" // 5 corresponds to Dao Admin. Each role has a code associated
} 
```

**Query**
```ts
const proofRequest: protocol.ZKPRequest = {
   id: 1,
   circuit_id: 'credentialAtomicQuerySig',
   rules: {
     query: {
       allowedIssuers: ['11A4eeoCN7Xdy5FZSd3BDxUS9yeA7FGGCCmpKPNhNP'], // ID of the trusted issuer
       schema: {
         type: 'PolygonDAOMember',
         url: 'https://schema.polygonid.com/jsonld/dao.json-ld',
       },
       req: {
         role: {
           $eq: 5, // the role must be 5 = Group Admin
         },
       },
     },
   },
 };
```

### Less-than

**Claim**

```json
AgeCredential {
  "birthDay": "19701230" //yymmdd
} 
```

**Query**
```ts
const proofRequest: protocol.ZKPRequest = {
   id: 1,
   circuit_id: 'credentialAtomicQuerySig',
   rules: {
     query: {
       allowedIssuers: ['113T3p9mwkNbRwsREgBwdjMdNJehAW5p6HcJSBpPjQ', '111DLXZwaj5Ag4hBneVgfb8FAy5EiyxjSkayVpqKj'], // ID of the trusted issuers
       schema: {
         type: 'AgeCredential',
         url: 'https://schema.polygonid.com/jsonld/kyc.json-ld',
       },
       req: {
         birthDay: {
           $lt: 20000101, // birthDay field less then 2000/01/01
         },
       },
     },
   },
 };
```

### Greater-than

**Claim**

```json
EmployeeData {
  "monthlySalary": "1650", //denominated in $$
  "employedSince": "20151230"
} 
```

**Query**
```ts
const proofRequest: protocol.ZKPRequest = {
   id: 1,
   circuit_id: 'credentialAtomicQuerySig',
   rules: {
     query: {
       allowedIssuers: ['*'],
       schema: {
         type: 'EmployeeData',
         url: 'https://schema.com/...employeedata',
       },
       req: {
         monthlySalary: {
           $gt: 1000, // monthlySalary must be over $1000
         },
       },
     },
   },
 };
```

### In

**Claim**

```json
UserGameItems {
  "item": "52", // 52 identifies a specific in-game item
}
```

**Query**
```ts
const proofRequest: protocol.ZKPRequest = {
   id: 1,
   circuit_id: 'credentialAtomicQuerySig',
   rules: {
     query: {
       allowedIssuers: ['*'],
       schema: {
         type: 'UserGameItems',
         url: 'https://schema.com/...usergameitems',
       },
       req: {
         item: {
           $in: [47, 52, 112, 145], // accept users that have an item included in the list
         },
       },
     },
   },
 };
```

### Not-in

**Claim**

```json
CountryOfResidenceCredential {
  "countryCode": "840"
} 
```

**Query**
```ts
const proofRequest: protocol.ZKPRequest = {
   id: 1,
   circuit_id: 'credentialAtomicQuerySig',
   rules: {
     query: {
       allowedIssuers: ['11BL1tHEwMR1tuCERfnaYbw4m5QPf45PKfFKZTL2Ep'], // ID of the trusted issuer
       schema: {
         type: 'CountryOfResidenceCredential',
         url: 'https://schema.polygonid.com/jsonld/kyc.json-ld',
       },
       req: {
         countryCode: {
           $nin: [840, 120, 340, 509], // accepted any country not in the list 
         },
       },
     },
   },
 };
```

> To add a operator-based query inside a proof request is not mandatory. For instance, a platform can just ask the user to have an AgeCredential claim as a way to identity unique humans without any requirements on the date of birth. In that case the veriifer should simply not fill the `req` field inside the proofRequest
