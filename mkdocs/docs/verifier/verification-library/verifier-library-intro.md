<b> Authenticate with Polygon ID workflow </b></div>

</div>

At its core, every interaction between a Verifier Platform and a user's Wallet follows this workflow:

- A web application designs an authentication request for the users that want to access the website. This is generated by the server and delivered to the user within a QR code (or via deep-linking; it is up to the implementer).
- The user scans the QR code using his/her mobile ID wallet and parses the request.
- The user generates a ZK proof on mobile according to the request of the website starting from the credentials held in his/her wallet.
- The user sends the proof to the callback server.
- The server verifies the ZK proof and if verified, grants this user access to the platform (or activates any customized logic).

Assume that the request is: "Are you over 18 years old?". The Verifier *never gets access to any of the user's credentials*. Instead, the Verifier receives a cryptographic proof which, on verification, provides an answer "yes" or "no" to the previous question. 

This section provides all the elements needed to integrate "Authentication with Polygon ID".

## Libraries

The authentication flow can be implemented either in GoLang or Javascript
