# Issuer Node Prerequisites
 
Before building and running Issuer Node, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker Daemon/Engine**: Docker Daemon or Docker Engine must  be installed on your system.
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose must be installed on your system. Docker Compose is used to start the multiple containers together.

> Note: You can install Docker Daemon and Docker Compose separately. Alternatively, you can install [Docker Desktop]((https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)) which includes both Daemon and Docker Compose. It is a tool to built and run containers for your applications. Due to its simplistic model, it removes the need to use CLI(Command Line Interface) to do core actions. With Docker Desktop, you can manage your containers from your application itself. 

- **Go**: If you intend to run the Issuer Node on an IDE, install the latest version of Go. If the Go backend is dockerized like other containers, there is no need to install Go locally.  

> Note: If you intend to run the Issuer Node via an IDE (Integrated Development Enviorment), you must have an IDE installed on your system. Please note that the Issuer Node is platform-agnostic and can be run via CLI, IDE, and even be deployed on cloud. For these tutorials, we shall explain how to run the Issuer Node on [GoLand IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).
