# Polygon ID Issuer Node APIs

The Issuer Node APIs provide a user with the following functionalities: 

- Create and retrieve Identities
- Create a Verifiable Credential (VC)
- Retrieve a Verifiable Credential or a list of Verifiable Credentials
- Generate JSON to create a QR Code and use that to accept credentials in wallet
- Revoke a Verifiable Credential
- Retrieve the Revocation Status of a Verifiable Credential
- Call Agent Endpoint using the Wallet App
 
These APIs can be tested locally on a <a href="https://self-hosted-platform.polygonid.me/#overview" target="_blank">Self Hosted Platform</a> or with our <a href="https://www.postman.com/dark-star-200015/workspace/public/collection/23322631-727c2573-3d62-4d58-9d46-0f479144d75d?action=share&creator=23322631" target="_blank">Postman Collection</a>. 



 

> Note: Please note that the API endpoints listed in the testing links above need to be called in sequential order. For example, you need to first create an identity before a Verifiable Credential can be issued by the Issuer Node.
