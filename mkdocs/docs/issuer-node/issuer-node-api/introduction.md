# Polygon ID Issuer Node APIs

The Issuer Node APIs provide a user with the following functionalities: 

- Create and Retrieve Identities
- Create Verifiable Credentials (VC)
- Retrieve a verifiable Credential or a list of Verifiable Credentials
- Revoke a Verifiable Credential
- Retrieve the Revocation Status of the Verifiable Credential
- Call Agent Endpoint using the Wallet App
 

These APIs can be tested locally on a [Self-Hosted Platform](https://self-hosted-platform.polygonid.me/#overview) or with our [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/dark-star-200015/workspace/public/collection/23322631-727c2573-3d62-4d58-9d46-0f479144d75d?action=share&creator=23322631). 

> Note: Please note that the API endpoints listed in the testing links above need to be called in sequential order. For example, you need to first create an identity before a Verifiable Credential can be issued by the Issuer Node.
