# Issuer Overview

An Issuer is any subject that issues Verifiable Credentials. You can think of a credentials as a statement: something an Issuer says about another subject. For example, when a university (Issuer) says that a student (subject) has a degree, this is a credentials.

An issuer might be: 

- A DAO that issues â€œmembership claims" to its members.
- A Government that issues ID to its citizens.
- An Face detection ML application that issues "proof of personhood" claims. 
- An employer that endorses its employees.

[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are a flexible data format able to express any type of information so that developers can unleash their creativity.

To operate, an Issuer must run an [Issuer Node](./issuer-node/issuer-node-overview.md), which is a self-hosted Node that exposes all the functionalities necessary to run an issuer.
