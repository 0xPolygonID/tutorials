# Issuer Overview

The issuer is any subject that issues claims. You can think of a claim as a statement: something an issuer says about another subject. For example, when a university (issuer) says that a student (subject) has a degree, this is a statement (claim).

An issuer might be: 

- A DAO that issues â€œmembership claims" to its members
- A Government that issues ID to its citizens
- An AI-based Application that issues "proof of personhood" claims 
- An employer that endorses its employees

[Claims](https://docs.iden3.io/protocol/claims-structure/) are a flexible data format able to express any type of information so that developers can unleash their creativity.

To operate, an issuer must set up a self-hosted server or directly interact with the Polygon ID Platform.
