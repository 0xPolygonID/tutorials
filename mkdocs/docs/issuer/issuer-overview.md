# Issuer Overview

An Issuer is any subject that issues Verifiable Credentials. You can think of a credentials as a statement: something an Issuer says about another subject. For example, when a university (Issuer) says that a student (subject) has a degree, this is a credential.

An issuer might be: 

- A DAO that issues â€œmembership claims" to its members.
- A Government that issues ID to its citizens.
- A Face detection ML application that issues "proof of personhood" claims. 
- An employer that endorses its employees.

[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are a flexible data format able to express any type of information so that developers can unleash their creativity.

To operate, an Issuer must run an [Issuer Node](../issuer-node/issuer-node-overview.md), which is a self-hosted Node that exposes all the functionalities necessary to run an issuer.

Using Polygon ID an Issuer can issue Credentials to their users.

## Issuer Node Types
There are basically two ways the Issuer Node can be implemented:

- Issuer Node Core API
- Issuer Node UI

### Issuer Node Core API
The [Issuer Node Core API](issuer-core.md) is ideal for users who need multiple identities, such as a large company or a university with many departments. For that last example, each department in a university would be represented by a single identity, capable of issuing credentials and creating schemas.

### Issuer Node UI
The [Issuer Node UI](issuer-ui.md) provides only a single identity. However, it also presents a few extra features, such as establishing connections and importing schemas. It is a ready for production environment with a full experience of being an issuer on Polygon ID. It comes in an API format but there is also a possibility to generate a full-fledged user interface.
