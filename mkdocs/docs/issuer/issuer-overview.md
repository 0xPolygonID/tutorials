# Issuer Overview

An Issuer is any subject that issues claims. You can think of a claim as a statement: something an Issuer says about another subject. For example, when a university (Issuer) says that a student (subject) has a degree, this is a statement (claim).

An issuer might be: 

- A DAO that issues â€œmembership claims" to its members.
- A Government that issues ID to its citizens.
- An AI-based application that issues "proof of personhood" claims. 
- An employer that endorses its employees.

To operate, an Issuer must set up a self-hosted server or directly interact with the Polygon ID Platform.
