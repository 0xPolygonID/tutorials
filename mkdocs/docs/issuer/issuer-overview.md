# Issuer Overview

The issuer is any subject that issues claims. You can think of a claim as a statement: something an issuer says about another subject. For example, when a university (issuer) says that a student (subject) has a degree, this is a statement (claim).

An issuer might be: 

- A DAO that issues â€œmembership claims" to its members
- A Government that issues ID to its citizens
- An AI-based Application that issues "proof of personhood" claims 
- An employer that endorses its employees

[Claims](../getting-started/claim/generic-claim.md) are a flexible data format able to express any type of information so that developers can unleash their creativity.

[Iden3 Core](../getting-started/getting-started.md) guides the reader through the core primitives that underpin the role of an Issuer.

To operate, an issuer must set up a self-hosted server or directly interact with the Polygon ID Platform.
