# Demo

To demo the interaction between a verifier application and a wallet: 

1. **Setup a verifier**

    - Follow the steps outlined in the [zk-login-integration](./zk-login-integration.md) to set up a client side verifier

    - If the server is running up locally, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to serve your application online `ngrok http 8080`

    - Add a QR code representing on the client side in order to interact with the identity wallet.

    > Check out this [static folder](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/tutorial-examples/tree/main/verifier-integration/js) to render the QR code containing the auth Request in a HTML page

2. **Download the identity wallet**

    - [Polygon ID iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/polygon-id/id1629870183)
    - [Polygon ID Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polygonid.wallet)


3. **Issue claims to your wallet to interact with the server**

    In the meanwhile you can use the claims generated via [Polygon Verify](https://verify.polygonid.com/) and fetch it inside your wallet.

4. **Prove your identity with Zero Knowledge**

    - Visit `<HOSTURL>` on your browser
    - From the wallet, scan the QR code associated with the auth request generated by the /api/sign-in endpoint

    The wallet will receive the auth request, generate the proof locally and send it to the callback url `<HOSTURL>/api/callback` in a post request. The server will verify the proof to authenticate the user.
